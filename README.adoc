= EXOR Embedded BSP

To get the BSP you need to have `repo` installed and use it as:

Install the `repo` utility:

[source,console]
$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Download the BSP source:

[source,console]
$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin
$: mkdir exor-yocto-6.0
$: cd exor-yocto-6.0
$: repo init -u https://github.com/ExorEmbedded/exor-bsp-platform -b kirkstone
$: repo sync

At the end of the commands you have every metadata you need to start work with.

To start a simple image build:

[source,console]
$: source git/poky/oe-init-build-env build
$: cp ../git/meta-exor/conf/bblayers.conf.sample conf/bblayers.conf
$: cp ../git/meta-exor/conf/local.conf.sample conf/local.conf
$: bitbake core-image-exor-wayland

You can use any directory to host your build.

The source code is checked out at `exor-yocto-6.0/git`.
